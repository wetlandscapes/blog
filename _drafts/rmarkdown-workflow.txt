This document provides some guidance on writing blogs for Jekyll with Rmarkdown. Eventually I'll write a script to do this automatically...

* I may actually be able to use the `blogdown` package to generate the documents I need
  * https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/jekyll.html
  
* It may be worth going through the kramdown documentation to avoid doing more html work than necessary:
  * https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html

## The workflow

1. Make a new folder in /_drafts/, to house the post.
2. Make the rmd file and write the post in rmarkdown, as normal.
3. Add this to the yaml front matter of the rmd file:

---
output:
  html_fragment:
    keep_md: yes
    self_contained: false
---

4. Use this line in knitr's setup chunk:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) #Optional
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../../assets/images/'<name-of-post>'/")
```

Note: replace '<name-of-post>' part of the path with the actual name of the post, including dashes.
Note: the "../../" part of the fig.path will mean that the figures will look "up" two folders from the relative path of the blog. We'll deal with this path in a moment.

5. Knit the file.
6. Move the output .md file to the /_posts/ folder.
7. Change the name of the /_posts/*.md file to include the date. For example: '2019-01-02-new-website.md'.
8. Delete the existin yaml frontmatter from the _post file, but add the following line:

---
permalink: /blog/:title/
---

Note: This resolves the second note of step 4. All the image links should be in working order now.
