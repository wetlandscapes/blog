A big part of the open science paradigm (which I am trying to apply to my research) is making research as reproducible as possible -- from data collection to publication and beyond. I've worked pretty hard over the last few years to become reasonably compotent at scripting and programming, largely in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). The application of such a skill is useful for a number of reasons:

1. Project review -- Allows others to critique my work, find bugs, etc.
2. Reproducible analysis -- Provides all the steps, assumptions, etc. to generate the main results of a paper.
3. Code repurposing -- Can act as an explict example of how to do a particular analysis.
4. Personal evaluation -- Acts as an archive of how my coding skills have improved over time.

To better hone my programming and data science skills, I have been working with the University of Wyoming's [Data Science Center](https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSC/overview), where myself and other students get hands-on experience using high performance computing, as well as other state of the art data analysis and modeling tools.

I'm still a bit shy about sharing my code, but as I develop some upcoming projects it is likely I'll be sharing a number of projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/wetlandscapes), as well as other long-term code & data repositories.

## Code repositories

Below are some common code (and data) repositories used in the context of reproducible research.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [OSF: Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
* [figshare](https://figshare.com/)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
