I'm obsessed with open science, so for my projects I tried to provide code for a couple of reasons:

* Reproducible research -- I'm hopefull that others can, perhaps, repurpose my code.
* Project review -- Allows others to critique my work, find bugs, etc.
* Archive -- Provides an illustration of how my coding skills have improved over time.

Places to store code:

* GitHub
* OSF

<!--
* GitLab
* BitBucket
