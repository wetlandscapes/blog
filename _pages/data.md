I'm somewhat obsessed with open science and reproducible research. To these ends I'm trying to share as much of my data as possible, as well as provide some other resources for finding open source data. My hope is that by sharing what I and others have collected or analyzed, we may squeeze every last drop of inference from the observations made.

Below are some of the data sets I've worked on, as well as some data sources and tools that I've found to be useful.

## Data from my projects

Liefert, D. T., Shuman, B. N., Parsekian, A. D., & __Mercer, J. J.__ (2017). Snowy Range seasonal lakes hydrology and geophysics. [https://doi.org/10.15786/M2F66V](https://doi.org/10.15786/M2F66V).

## General resources for open source data related to the environment

### Isotope Hydrology
* [WaterIsotopes.org](http://wateriso.utah.edu/waterisotopes/index.html)
  * A very popular and active website housing global water isotope data.
* [WISER: Water Isotope System for Data Analysis, Visualization, and Electronic Retrieval](http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/IHS_resources_isohis.html)
  * Contains data for both the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation and Rivers (GNIP and GNIR).
* [Stable Water Vapor Isotopes Database](https://vapor-isotope.yale.edu/)
  * A global atmospheric vapor data base.

### General Hydrology

* [CRAN Task View: Water Science](https://github.com/ropensci/hydrology)
  * Includes not just tools for downloading data (using the R programming language), but also a number of tools for analyzing water-related data.
* [Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/)
