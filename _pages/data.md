I think opening up the scientific black box is important. I'm therefore trying to ensure the data I collect becomes publically available, thereby maximizing its benefit to society. Along these lines I'm working on submitting data to a number of searchable repositories. These include:

### Isotope Hydrology
* Waterisotopes.org
* WISER (IAEA/WMO)
* SWVID

### Generaly Hydrology

* Hydroshare
* DataOne

### General

* Open Science Framework
* Zenodo
* Figshare
