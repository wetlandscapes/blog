Hi,<br />My name's Jason and I'm a PhD student at the University of Wyoming in the Department of Botany. The intent of this blog is to more or less to catalog things I'm doing, stuff I've seen, problems I've over come - largely technical, but with perhaps some more personal elements as well - and generally work on my ability to communicate via the written word.
