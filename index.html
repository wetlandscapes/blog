I am currently a PhD candidate in the Hydrological Sciences program and Department of Botany at the University of Wyoming. My research is loosely organized around the fields of hydrology, ecology, and soil physics with a particular emphasis on mountain wetlands, lakes, and streams. Common tools I use to address my research interests include stable water isotopes, near-surface geophysics (e.g., GPR, NMR), process-based modeling (with an emphasis on Bayesian techniques), and remote sensing (e.g., structure from motion). I'm a big advocate of open science, and thus this site focuses a lot on those aspects of my work.

To do:

* Look into how to get site hosted through Amazon
  * https://medium.com/@jameshamann/migrating-your-jekyll-website-to-aws-bc9582b3fbb2
  * http://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/host-jekyll-website-on-aws/692/5
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sshXVtr29HU
  * https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/
* Make a new GitHub profile: jjmercer or wetlandscapes or ecojydrology
* More on using Font Awesome buttons:
  * https://www.w3schools.com/icons/default.asp
  * Ex., Mendeley button: https://fontawesome.com/icons/mendeley?style=brands
* Make images enlarge when clicked on.
  * Possible solution? https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/155
* Research
  * Link acadmeic profiles to page: Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, Research Gate, Mendeley, ORCID
  * How can I make a table from ORCID? My ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6193-5032
  * Use font awesome buttons to link profiles
    * Font awesome example for Mendeley: fas fa-fw fab fa-mendeley
	  * https://fontawesome.com/icons/mendeley?style=brands
* Code
  * Add links: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
* Add header images to each page: About, Research, Code
* Update the footer with some key links
  * These are located in the _config.yml file @ footer: links: label:/icon:/url:
  * Buttons:
    * Twitter
	* LinkedIn
* What is up with the "ERROR `/sw.js' not found." error?


Future projects:

* Add my twitter stream to the right-hand side of the site.
* How do I link/port blog posts from DSC to my page?
* Add preview images to posts.
* How to get really long links to wrap properly.
