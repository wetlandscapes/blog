# Functionalities beyond GitHub

## General

* Make pictures expandable -- If you click on them they get bigger
* Should write some regression tests
  * I could make sure all my links work with RSelenium
* Update fonts
  * Author: Make sure they are all black and white
  * Get the academicons working and add
    * ORCID
	* Mendeley
  * Possible solutions:
    * https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/798
	* https://github.com/jonbra/jonbra.github.io
	  * Seems like this person got academicons working on his site.
	* https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/

## Home

* Twitter feed
  * See Scarpino website

## About

## Blog

* Write an actual "new website" blog.
* Include preview images instead of just a verbal descriptions
  * Example (using mimimal mistakes?): https://jonbra.github.io/publications/

## Research

* Drop down button with mutliple sections:
  * About my research
  * Highlighted projects
  * Where to find my works, as well as a list of publications
    * Integration/syncing with ORCID
	  * Add MSc to ORCID database
	    * https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973133-Add-works-to-your-ORCID-record
	  * Add data-set from lakes manuscript to ORCID database
	    * https://members.orcid.org/api/resources/work-types
	  * Resolve ResearchGate DOI or get a new one
	    * https://explore.researchgate.net/display/support/ResearchGate+DOIs
	  * Bold my name in citation list
	    * Possible example: https://github.com/jgoodall/jgoodall.github.io
    * Some additional publications functionality: https://github.com/jgoodall/jekyll-scholar-extras
* Alternatively, I could just make separate pages for each of these, which would probably be simpler
  * Research (philosophy and focus)
  * Projects (highlight projects)
  * Publications (Publications and where to find my academic activities)

## Data

* ~~Rotate the header picture just a little bit~~
* Add a link to my activities with the Data Science Center
  * https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSC/overview
* Just add some thoughts on open data
* Include some data sources of interest
* Once I've add more do the sources above, I can include links to those resources
* Link papers to data sets
  * Ex: Why are some Rocky Mountain lakes ephemeral?
    * Paper: https://doi.org/10.1029/2017WR022261
	* Data:  https://doi.org/10.15786/M2F66V
  * Is there some automated way of doing this?

* I may want to consider a similar strucutre here as in the research page
  * General (philosophy and resources)
  * Projects (Project-specific data)
    * This would include links and DOIs to data associated with specific papers or efforts

## Code

Websites with examples of functionalities:

 * http://scarpino.github.io/; https://github.com/scarpino/scarpino.github.io
 
## Other pages of interest

* Image gallery
  * Use the gallery concept: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/
  
## Other issues of interest

* Consider hosting page on GitLabs
  * They do not appear to have the same Jekyll plugin restrictions that Github has:
